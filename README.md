# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot (Using if-else)

🎯 Objective

Create a simple chatbot that can respond to user messages using if-elif-else logic.
This project helps you understand the basic structure of conversation flow — the foundation of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Language: Python
Modules Used: Built-in (no external libraries needed)

📦 Features

✅ Responds to greetings and simple queries
✅ Understands commands like asking for time or date
✅ Uses input/output loops for continuous conversation
✅ Uses rule-based logic (if-elif-else)
✅ Demonstrates the foundation of NLP systems

🧠 Learning Outcome

By building this chatbot, you’ll:
Understand how chatbots handle user input and responses.
Learn how rule-based logic forms the core of early NLP systems.
Get comfortable using loops, conditions, and string matching in Python.

🧪 Example Interaction
🤖 ChatBot: Hi there! I'm your friendly chatbot.
Type 'bye' to end the chat.

You: hello
🤖 ChatBot: Hello! How can I help you today?

You: what is the time
🤖 ChatBot: The time is 04:30 PM

You: bye
🤖 ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day! 👋

💡 Next Steps (Upgrade Ideas)

Add sentiment or intent detection using nltk or spaCy.
Integrate speech recognition for voice-based chatting.
Train a machine learning model to classify user intents automatically.
Deploy it on a website or Telegram bot for real interaction.
